## Automated and Manual Testing

The generation of unit tests reveals as it being one of the most important aspects of software development. Creating unit tests to evaluate the behavior of the different units within the system is a vital procedure to ensure the system works as intended. However, one must take into account how this procedure can be done. 

Two different methods to create unit tests are known. They can be generated using human effort, in a manual manner or can be generated automatically through the use of state-of-the-art unit test generation algorithms, for example. This last sentence brings forth a relevant question, "Which of them should be used over the other?". This work does not elaborate on this question, however certain points can be said about their differences.


- *Scaling problems*:
    - Manual generation can be an exhaustive and a time-consuming process. It scales with the size of the project. Projects with a great amount of parts require even more unit tests to be created. Manually creating these tests for that great amount can hinder the development speed of the software. 
    - Automated generation, being an automated process, can help reduce the time needed to perform this process. A manual procedure tends to be more time-consuming than a automated one [1].
