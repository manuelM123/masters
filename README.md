# 4 Search-Based Test Generation

**UUT** - unit under testing

- Things to look for when performing test cases:
    - Exceptions in the unit under testing;
    - Code coverage => cover all the lines of a code;
    - Verifying every outcome possible (identifying inputs for every possible output value or most);
    - Executing a wide variety of inputs and determinr which set has the highest diversity.

- Process of Test Generation using Metaheuristic algorithms:

    1. Use of fitness functions to evaluate certain solutions (tests suites with one or more unit tests);
    2. Use of metaheuristic algorithms to take those solutions and come up with a improved solution;
    3. Repeat the process until a certain threshold.
